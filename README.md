# Wildfound

Wildfound is a tool for exploring the many ecosystems and species of the world from the comfort of your browser - no downloads (or travel) necessary. Wildfound is a spiritual successor to a tool called Wildfinder that was once provided online by the World Wildlife Fund, and is built on top of the same database. With Wildfound, you can explore different levels of geographic and taxonomic division, to see how different aspects of the natural world fit together, where they are similar, and where they aren't.

Wildfound is built with Express.js, Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and Tailwind. It is currently not available live, but a live version should be coming soon.
