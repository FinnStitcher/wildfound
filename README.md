# Wildfound

Wildfound is a tool for exploring the many ecosystems and species of the world from the comfort of your browser - no downloads (or travel) necessary. Wildfound is a spiritual successor to a tool called Wildfinder that was once provided online by the World Wildlife Fund, and is built on top of the same database. It's a hobbyist project; I built it specifically so I could explore that data, which is available free to download on the WWF website.

Wildfound is built with Express.js, Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and Tailwind. It is available live at https://wildfound-production.up.railway.app/.
